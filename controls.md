# Controls

There are a lot of controls in EmuVR, and each core also supports control mapping via RetroArch. It is important to note that this document covers controls used mainly by EmuVR and **NOT** RetroArch, as those can be mapped by running RetroArch.exe or using the RetroArch menu while running a game.

At this time you can play using Keyboard/Mouse, Vive Wands, Oculus Touch, or gamepads that support XInput/can emulate XInput via software.


This list is incomplete- a ? represents a control that has not yet been confirmed/documented.

#In-Game (Vive/Touch)

EmuVR also remaps keys on your Vive/Touch to keys found on consoles, if you wish to play with them instead of a gamepad.

##Vive
`RPadUp = A
RPadLeft = LShoulder
RPadRight = RShoulder
RPadDown = Back
RTrigger = B
Right Menu = X
Right Grip = Y
Left Menu = Start
Left Pad = Left Analog/D-Pad
Left Grip + Right Pad(Touch, don't click) = Right Analog
`

##Touch
`A = A
B = B
Right Trigger = X
Right Grab = Y
Left Thumbstick (press) = LB
Left Trigger = RB
Y = Start
X = Back
Left analog and right analog = left analog and right analog
Left Analog = DPad on systems without analog.

To use the DPad on systems *with* analog sticks, press the right stick and use the left as a dpad.
