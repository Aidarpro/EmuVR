# How to control a game
Hold the modifier button (index finger on touch, grip on vive) to show a laser pointer. Point it to a tv running a game, and press A or X on touch, or trackpad Down on vive (any hand)
then it will swap all input to the game, and you can't control your avatar anymore, until you press the exit command: press both thumb sticks on touch/gamepad, or both "menu button"s on the vive
then you'll get to control yourself again
