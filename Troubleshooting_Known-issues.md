* "I can't see any consoles or carts"
   * Within any console folder within the Games directory, check the "emuvr_core.txt" file for the appearance of "1". Where present, this is an error. Open the Game Scanner, change any setting, then click "Save" and close the scanner. Check the emuvr_core.txt again, and if "1" is no longer present, start EmuVR and see if your content is available.
